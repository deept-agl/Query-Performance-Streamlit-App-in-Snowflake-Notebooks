# 📊 Interactive Query Performance Streamlit App in Snowflake Notebooks

This is a simple interactive Streamlit app that runs inside **Snowflake Notebooks** to help you analyze **query performance**.

It pulls data from the `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` table and shows visual insights about the longest-running queries using filters and charts.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Select a **timeframe**: day, week, or month  
- Choose how many top queries to display  
- Filter queries by **SQL command** (e.g., SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE)  
- See:
  - A **histogram** of query execution times  
  - A **boxplot** showing execution time spread  
  - Raw data and summary stats

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Just run the code inside a **Snowflake Notebook** with Streamlit imported.

Make sure you're connected to your Snowflake environment and your role have access to `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY`.
